# [How A/B Tests do Causal Inference?](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-do-a-b-tests-work-996842ce6fc0)

Same as **Randomization Controlled Trials**, the key points are **Randomization** and **Control**.

- **Randomization** allows statistically identical groups.
- **Control** allows comparison between treatment effects.

### A/B test:

- Different treatments applied
- Treatments randomly assigned
- Scientific hypothesis tested

### Hypothesis testing:

- Default action: *treatment a*
- Alternative action: *treatment b*
- Null hypothesis: differences between *effects* are more than $10%$.
- Alternative hypothesis: differences between *effects* are less than $10%$.

By designing such an **experiment**, the data can be collected to show the significance of causal effects.
